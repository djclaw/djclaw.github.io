<h2>What it is</h2>
<p>A lightweight personal Wikipedia built on a Raspberry Pi. Each entry is a static HTML page with a classic wiki feel. A small search index keeps it fast and simple.</p>

<h2>Why it exists</h2>
<p>I wanted one place to store what matters — projects, tools, and ideas — without clutter. It should be readable today and useful years from now. No feeds, no noise, just a clean record.</p>

<h2>How it works (3 steps)</h2>
<p><strong>Collect → Structure → Publish</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Collect notes locally (history logs first).</li>
  <li>Structure them into entries with tags, categories, and links.</li>
  <li>Publish as static pages with search.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Privacy, by design</h2>
<p>Sensitive data never goes to GitHub. The database stays local; only static pages are published. Everything is quiet, safe, and controllable.</p>

<h2>Roadmap</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>MVP1/2</strong>: layout, search, bilingual UI framework.</li>
  <li><strong>MVP3</strong>: real personal data, local SQLite, privacy filtering.</li>
  <li><strong>MVP4</strong>: clearer scope, smarter extraction, stricter review — only after the rules are set.</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s the project: a calm, local-first wiki that grows slowly and stays clean.</p>
